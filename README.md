# QRSII & GNE output data visualization

The output of QRS & GNE isn't quite handy to be directly put into excel or other web app.

This web app wants to help visualize those output data.

The datas have been prepered by https://github.com/AntoineGiraud/QRS-GNE_outputFormater.

**QRSII** stands for *Quick Response System*. It enables you to perform a [sequential four-step model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_forecasting#Four-step_models) based on the .dat files created by GNE.
